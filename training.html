												<h3>Zero to hero: Create and host a website</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Creating a website is easy with modern tools, like wordpress or sitebuilders. The downside is that hosting these sites has a running cost and some website builder services are open to attack.

												In this course we show you how to make a static website from the ground up. We start with HTML, CSS and Javascript, to allow you to create adaptive content for desktop and mobile devices, as well as track your visitors. Then we show you how to host your website on a service that doesn't have monthly fees and is secure.

												<h3>Advanced: Create your first pipeline to publish a website</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												If you already have a website that you want to publish, there are many steps to making changes go public. A pipeline can automate this for you and also run tests on any updated code or content.

												We use an Amazon Web Services example to publish a containerised website, to a live site using Elastic Container Service and a custom written CI/CD pipeline you can adapt for future projects.

												<h3>Adaptive: Using AI in your workflow</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Everyone is aware how AI is changing how we work today. If you want to avoid repetitive tasks or if you need some inspiration for a new project, AI can often provide the scaffolding to get you started.

												In this coure, we explore a number of ways AI can be used with traditional office apps, using a question strategy that can get to the content you need quicker. If you are a developer, we also look at how AI tools can assist in scaffolding a class or creating suggested unit tests to enhance your code, as well as some of the modern IDE's that integrate AI tools.
